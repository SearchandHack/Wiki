# How It Works

#### Step 1: Subscribe
After subscribing you will receive an email with an invite to our private discord server.

#### Step 2: Choose a Quest
Every weekend from Thursday to Monday, we will have real-life quests/missions ready to begin with.

#### Step 3: Complete quests
By working together with community members on a quest, you will have access to a shared Google Doc to fill out your findings regarding the quest at hand. We will gather every finding and publish a public report of our findings by the end of the quest.

#### Step 4: Build actual work experience
By engaging in weekly quests from multiple categories, you will build and gain multiple skills, from collaborating with peers to working on real-life challenges that are real! You will also gain recognition through the reports we publish for every quest; if you discover something while working on a quest, it will be included in the report. You will also enjoy other benefits, that we offer.
