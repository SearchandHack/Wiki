**How It Works**

##### Step 1: Subscribe
After subscribing, you will receive an email with an invite to our private discord server.

##### Step 2: Choose a Quest
Every weekend from Thursday to Monday, we will have real-life quests/missions ready to begin.

##### Step 3: Complete quests
By working together with community members on a quest, you will have access to a shared Google Doc to fill out your findings regarding the quest at hand. We will gather every finding and publish a public report of our findings by the end of the quest.

##### Step 4: Build actual work experience
By engaging in weekly quests from multiple categories, you will build and gain multiple skills, from collaborating with peers to working on real-life challenges that are real! You will also gain recognition through the reports we publish for every quest; if you discover something while working on a quest, it will be included in the report. You will also enjoy other benefits that we offer.

#### 2) What is the concept of quests?
Quests are real-life cybersecurity missions to complete. For instance, in our OSINT quests, we will be working on a real OSINT case. On adversary hunting, we will have real adversary infrastructure to hunt, and so on.

After completing every quest, we will collect community submissions and findings, then produce a public report on it. Like that, you also get to build a name for yourself and show off your skills.
